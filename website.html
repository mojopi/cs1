	<h1>this is my journal</h1>

	<p>I have just finished coding sections of a <a href="https://mojopi.github.io/cs1/">soccer goal</a> to link to my journal, projects, and about me pages. It is a bit frustrating because coding takes forever, but it is also exciting to see the website coming together. During this process I have solidified the basics and I am starting to learn new things like how to have two divs next to each other. For the next week or two I want to clean up my homepage, and spend some time on the other pages (journal, about me, projects).
