                    <li>Choose a partner in your class (or two) who you can code with over video chat or reach out to in order to ask questions when you're stuck. Have one person from you buddy group Slack me privately to tell me who your partner(s) is/are.</li><br>

            Here are some guidelines about process for the items on this checklist</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Coming up with an idea:</b> you have an authentic need (like a gift you want to give someone) OR you're inspired by something you see perhaps on the class website or on <a href='https://jenniferdewalt.com/'>Jennifer Dewalt's website</a> of code sketches.</li>
                <li><b>Planning:</b> You make a quick blueprint or mock up of what you're going to make and how it's going to work (<a href="resources.html">here is my octopus arm code sketch and mock up.</a>)</li>
                <li><b>You program it:</b> You use sublime text (or another text editor), and you have it open next to your Chrome browser window. Each time you make a change, you save and refresh your browser window. You use the console to debug. You google things when you don't have the words for them (e.g. how do I set the width for a div CSS) and look at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>. You refer to the <a href="resources.html">class resources page</a> for videos and cheat sheets. When you're stuck, you message the class slack channel and we'll help you!</li>

Feel free to use the <a href="https://paper.bywetransfer.com/">paper app</a> on a phone to draw or do it by hand. Take a photograph of your drawing and post it on your personal website with a description so that other people will be able to see it.

                                <li>Based on what you've read, what are some applications of computer vision that you find exciting? What are some that you are concerned about?</li>
                                <li>What does it mean that he gets an "invisibility cloak". In what ways does it make him invisible.</li>
                                <li>What is adversarial fashion? What is it's purpose and why does it work? What's the goal of it? Check out some adversarial fashion <a href="https://adversarialfashion.com/">here.</a></li>
                                <li>What do you think a neural net is?</li>
                                <li>Do you believe that you should have a right to privacy and anonymity? Is there a cost to this right?</li>

                        <td><b>What not to do:</b> <br> You skim the reading and don't highlight (in preview you can highlight) parts that you find interesting. You were multitasking while reading so you can't recall an examples of adversarial fashion. For your drawing you made something that one of the people referenced in the article has already made.<br><br>
                            <b>What to do:</b><br>read the questions in the first column and keep them in your mind. annotate your article on your computer, if you don't print it out, so that when we talk about it, you can reference ideas you had while reading. Make sure to mark things that you find particularly interesting! Do a Google serch up terms you don't know.

Why is meaningful or relevant to your life), and who it's for 3) a photograph of a storyboard or blueprint of your project, and 4) a PLAN with the project broken into pieces (i.e. First I'll make a small div that says "hi" when you click on it, secondly I'll make a codesketch where this works for 10 divs, etc.) and the DATE you plan to do each part by.</td>

In addition to making the code sketch, you have linked it to your website and written a post in your journal about your code, why you chose to make what you made, what exponential means to you now vs. before.</td>
