Notes for Classes Monday and Tuesday

Hi, so good to see you. Maybe a little bit about where I am and what I’ve been working on — podcast and children’s book.

First all say hi to each other and wave.

Share with them the podcast episode and then the book:

First off, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ARE SIGNED INTO OUR CLASS’ SLACK CHANNEL.

C periods: https://dalton.slack.com/archives/CUW6V0FN2

H period:https://dalton.slack.com/archives/CUU1BU02Z
I period: https://dalton.slack.com/archives/CUU1CRP1T

Here are the instructions for joining Slack if you have not already done so:

* Download slack from the software center.
* Open it and it should give you a prompt to sign in to your work environment at the ____.slack.com. In that blank spot in the slack prompt, enter your school's name.
* Sign in with your school's gmail
* To join your class's channel search in "join channel" for cs1- and then your period's letter [e.g. c, f, h, i])
* In addition to messaging your class, when you want/need individual help you can message me directly!
* If you have a smartphone, download slack on yor smartphone if you so choose and sign in


Make a quick “pictionary” style sketch of something you’ve been thinking about, a question you have, a show you’ve been watching, a book you’ve been reading, or a creative project you’re working on over the past few weeks. 

Hold up that sketch to the camera and then a few people will share. Then, we’re going to turn those quick drawings into a mock up for a code sketch. You’ll be making these code sketches in pairs and using a new tool that I’ll be introducing called glitch: 

1. You’ll be broken into separate rooms of 2 randomly in zoom
2. Go to https://glitch.com/
3. ONE OF YOU  on glitch.com, choose “New Project” on the top and from the drop-down menu choose “hello-webpage”
4. Sign into glitch using your GitHub account (i.e. click on the octopus logo option and it will automatically sign in with your GitHub account, just authorize it).
5. Where it says “share”on the top left, click and from the drop down menu, copy the link that says “invite others to edit” and send the link to your partner via the chat function in zoom. Then, under “share,” choose the other option — copy the link to the project page— and share that in the class Slack channel
6. Click the sunglasses and the word “show” on the top left side on the page next to the word to render your code so far. You can either see how the code renders in the same window or in a different window. I recommend the same window
7. Talk through your mock up ideas and make a joint code sketch. 
8. Work on your joint code sketch over zoom and send it in by tomorrow!




I need to make a code sketch — something that represents my break? My hi and low?



If it’s the huge class, break them into rooms of 4?
