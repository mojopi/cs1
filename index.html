                <h1>üëã HELLO</h1>
                <p>Hello! <br>There are different reasons why each of you decided to take CS1. Whatever the reason, I‚Äôm really happy you‚Äôre here! I‚Äôd love to hear about who you are, what brought you here, your interests, and what you care about. </p>
                <p>
                    My hopes for this class are that we each uncover and leverage diverse tastes and interests to make personally meaningful, expressive, projects with real audiences; projects we're proud of and want to share with the world. </p>
                <p>In this course, we‚Äôll primarily be programming with
                    <!-- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjl6gbg9kmk"> HTML</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP9QMdoXvXE">CSS</a>, and--> Javascript. In addition to programming, we‚Äôll also be developing all kinds of skills around explicitly articulating our mental models of how things work, translating our interests into concrete projects, and managing ourselves and our projects so we can end up with digital artifacts that are functional, personally meaningful, and somewhat whimsical and magical.
                </p>

        <div class="textbox">
            <h2>üí° What we'll be doing/learning</h2>
            <p>This course will be centered around you using similar toolsets to do diverse projects that reflect your tastes and interests. Therefore, each of you will be learning and doing slightly different things. However, you'll all be developing certain skillsets related to creating original digital projects. These capacities include but are not limited to:</p>
            <h3>üóìÔ∏è Project Management Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Translating your interests into concrete project ideas</li> <br>
                <li>Specifying and designing a programming project</li> <br>
                <li>Breaking the project into discrete parts and planning when you'll finish each part </li> <br>
                <li>Breaking each part into even smaller programmable code-sketches</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>üíª Skills Related to Web Development & Programming</h3>
            <p>In the process of creating and formatting webpages that represent ideas you care about, you'll end up being able to do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create, format, and style elements on a webpage in a way that you find beautiful and that work on a computer (and a smartphone)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Debug a problem in your code by using your console, google, such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/guides/beginner/">css tricks</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">mdn</a>, etc., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q">pair programming</a>, and talking through problems with each other.</li> <br>
                    <li>Like in an art class, you'll each add to your palette of computational tools and ideas to make all kinds of things! Instead of paint colors, your pallette might consist of using
                        <ul>
                            <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G41G_PEWFjE">variables</a>,
                            </li>
                            <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWQfa4CHbw">functions,</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDi7xgIIW8E">if else statements</a>,</li>
                            <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seBDTeZmb-k">arrays</a>, </li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIlCLjjm8M0">for loops</a> </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> You will use these to make different kinds of visualizations and interactions on websites</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h3>üí≠Thinking about Thinking</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Seeing your own mental models</b>: When I write a computer program and the outcome is different from what I expect, it's often because I have a misconception. Somthing I love about coding is that, I can SEE my misconceptions.
                                <br><br>Similarly I love that there's no right answer. Instead, the difference between how you and someone else solve a problem reflects a beautiful diversity in thought which you can actually <i>see</i> in the code! In this class, you'll learn to think and talk more explicitlly about your thinking!
                            </li>
                            <br><br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Debugging</b>: In CS1, we'll often use our console and trial and error to debug problems, but we'll also discuss what we predict our code will do, what it actually does, and our assumptions about how we think things work. This will help us get better at thinking about our own thinking!
                            </li>
                        </ul>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="expectations">
        <div class="textbox">
            <h1>Expectations</h1>
            <ol>
                <h3>
                    <li>Collaboration
                </h3> There's really no competition in and no scarcity of good grades in this class. If you make a good project, you'll have it on your personal website forever and I want each person to make things they care about! Thus, you are <i>expected</i> to help each other a lot! Don't think of collaborating as cheating. It's important that we support each other because we won't be able to get everything done without collaboration!</li><br><br>
                <h3>
                    <li>Humility
                </h3> Tech culture is infamous for know-it-all vibes. Let's do something better! There is no single right answer in programming. In fact, usually there are tons of "right answers" as long as the code works! For that reason and because we want a vibrant, inclusive, supportive vibe, no matter how techy you may feel, in this class you're expected to be kind, helpful, and use your knowledge to help yourself and others. Here we're not into showing off just to look smart! Don't make anyone feel less technical than you and if you don't feel or identify as techical, don't worry about it! It really isn't relevant ‚Äî you can make great stuff in this class even if you've never used a computer before!</li>
                <h3>
                    <li>Weekly Journaling and Publishing Your Website (<a href="http://goerkederyk.weebly.com/creating-a-flying-machine.html">Best Example I've ever seen</a>)
                </h3> In the journal sections of your personal websites each week, you'll document and capture what you've been working on and what progress you've made on your project. You can use photos of drawings or whatever else to make your thinking visible. Each weekly journal entry should include an explanation of:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b style="font-size:20px;">The process:</b> how you made what you made. How did you come up with the idea? How did you test it or make a smaller version? What went wrong in the process? How did you debug? What resources did you use to help you?</li>
                       <br><br>
                    <li><b style="font-size:20px;">How do you think it works, in your own words</b>: How did you write your code and why did you do it that way? What is your understanding of how this works?</li>
                    <br><br>
                    <li><b style="font-size:20px;">How you're feeling about what you made</b>: What are you happy with, frustrated about, which dimensions do you understand or not understandetc</li>
                    <br><br>
                    <li> <b style="font-size:20px;">What you want to do next:</b> What are your next steps? </li>
                    <br><br>
                </ul>
                    <h3>
                        <li>
                            Working on your project at least 2-3 hrs/wk
                    </h3> If you're not spending at least 2-3 hours per week programming or working on your project, then your project is probably not going to be as good as it can be!</li>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>
                        <li>Small Group Weekly Labs
                    </h3>Each of you should be having a small group Lab every week and you must have your first Lab with me in the first few weeks of school!</li>

                    <h3>
                        <li>Ask for help!
                    </h3>
                    If you can't figure something out within 30 minutes, you are expected to post a question to our class Slack chat</li>
