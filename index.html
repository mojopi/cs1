                <h1>üëã Welcome</h1>
                <p>Hello! <br>There are different reasons why each of you decided to take CS1. Whatever the reason, I‚Äôm really happy you‚Äôre here! I‚Äôd love to hear about who you are, what brought you here, your interests, and what you care about. </p>
                <p>
                    My hopes for this class are that we each uncover and leverage diverse tastes and interests to make personally meaningful, expressive, projects with real audiences; projects we're proud of and want to share with the world. </p>
                <p>In this course, we‚Äôll primarily be programming with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjl6gbg9kmk">HTML</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP9QMdoXvXE">CSS</a>, and Javascript. In addition to programming, we‚Äôll also be developing all kinds of skills around explicitly articulating our mental models of how things work, translating our interests into concrete projects, and managing ourselves and our projects so we can end up with digital artifacts that are functional, unique, and somewhat whimsical and magical:)
                </p>

        <div class="textbox">
            <h2>üí° Some of what we'll be doing/learning</h2>
            <p>This course will be centered around you using similar toolsets to do divergent projects that reflect your tastes and interests! Therefore, each of you will be learning and doing slightly different things! However, you'll all be developing certain skillsets related to creating original digital projects including but not limited to:</p>
            <h3>üóìÔ∏è Project Management Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Translating your interests into concrete project ideas</li> <br>
                <li>Specifying and designing a programming project</li> <br>
                <li>Breaking the project into different parts and planning when you'll finish each part </li> <br>
                <li>Breaking each part into even smaller programmable code-sketches</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>üíª Skills Related to Web Development & Programming</h3>
            <p>In the process of creating and formatting webpages that represent ideas you care about, you'll end up being able to do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create, format, and style elements on a webpage in a way that you find beautiful and that work on a computer (and a smartphone)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Debug a problem in your code by using your console, google, resources such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/guides/beginner/">css tricks</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">mdn</a>, etc., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q">pair programming</a>, and talking through problems with each other.</li> <br>
                    <li>Like in an art class, you'll all to your palette of computational tools and ideas to make all kinds of things! For example, your pallette might include using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G41G_PEWFjE">variables</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWQfa4CHbw">functions</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDi7xgIIW8E">if statements</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seBDTeZmb-k">arrays</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIlCLjjm8M0">for loops,</a> to make different representations and functionalities on a webpage! </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>üí≠Thinking about Thinking</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Seeing your own mental models</b>: When I write a program and the outcome is different from what I expect, it's often because I have a misconception. Somthing I love about coding is that, I can SEE my misconceptions.
                        <br><br>Similarly I love that there's no right answer. Instead, the difference between how you and someone else solve a problem reflects a beautiful diversity in thought which you can actually <i>see</i> in the code! <br><br> In this class, you'll learn to think and talk more explicitlly about your thinking!
                    </li>
                    <br><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Debugging</b>: In CS1, we'll often use our console and trial and error to debug problems, but we'll also discuss what we predict our code will do, what it actually does, and our assumptions about how we think things work. This will help us get better at thinking about our own thinking!
                    </li>

            <h1>Expectations</h1>
            <ol>
                <h3>
                    <li>Collaboration
                </h3> In this class, computation and computer programming is what we're <i>using</i> to create personally meaningful projects. You're not being assessed "about" computer programming. You'll be assessing your own success based on your individual development and your own projects.<br><br> Thus, there's really no competition in and no scarcity of good grades in this class. If you make a cool project, you'll have it on your personal website forever and I want each person to make things they care about! Thus, you are <i>expected</i> to help each other a lot! Don't think of collaborating as cheating. It's important that we support each other because we won't be able to get everything done without collaboration!</li><br><br>
                <h3>
                    <li>Humility
                </h3> Techy culture is infamous for mansplaining. Let's do something better! There is no single right answer in programming. In fact, usually there are tons of "right answers" as long as the code works! For that reason and because we want a vibrant, inclusive, supportive vibe, no matter how techy you may feel, in this class you're expected to be kind, helpful, and use your knowledge to help yourself and others. Here we're not into showing off just to look smart! Don't make anyone feel less technical than you and if you don't feel or identify as techical, don't worry about it! It really isn't relevant ‚Äî you can make great stuff in this class even if you've never used a computer before!</li>
                <h3>
                    <li>Weekly Journal (<a href="http://goerkederyk.weebly.com/creating-a-flying-machine.html">2</a> <a href="https://mojopi.github.io">examples</a> of a journal)
                </h3> On your personal websites each week, you'll each submit one code-sketch (often related to your personal project), an explanation of how it works, what you like/don't like about it, and a reflection about what you're learning. You can use photos of drawings or whatever else to make your thinking visible!</li>
                <br><br>
                <h3>
                    <li>Up-to-date Trello (<a href="https://trello.com/b/ZbU0nkw7/mj-cs1-projects">example</a> of a trello board)
                </h3> 
                It's expected that you use you're trello is up to date. That you've listed all parts of your project and that you're moving them around your different "lists" based on how you'r managing your project.</li>
                <br><br>
                <h3>
                    <li>
                        Working on your project at least 3-4 hrs/wk
                </h3> If you're not spending at least 3-4 hours per week programming or working on your project, then your project is probably not going to be as good as it can be!</li>
                <br><br>
                <h3>
                    <li>Weekly Labs
                </h3>Each of you should be having an individual or small group Lab every week and you must have a 1:1 Lab with me in the first two weeks of school!</li>
                <br><br>
                <h3>
                    <li>Ask for help!
                </h3>
                If you can't figure something out within 30 minutes, you are expected to post a question to our TKclass Slack chat, on TKthis form!</li>
