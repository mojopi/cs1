                <h1>üëã Welcome</h1>
                <p>Hello! <br>There are different reasons why each of you decided to take CS1. Whatever the reason, I‚Äôm really happy you‚Äôre here! I‚Äôd love to hear about who you are, what brought you here, your interests, and what you care about. </p>
                <p>
                    My hopes for this class are that we each uncover and leverage diverse tastes and interests to make personally meaningful, expressive, projects with real audiences; projects we're proud of and want to share with the world. </p>
                <p>In this course, we‚Äôll primarily be programming with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjl6gbg9kmk">HTML</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP9QMdoXvXE">CSS</a>, and Javascript. In addition to programming, we‚Äôll also be developing all kinds of skills around explicitly articulating our mental models of how things work, translating our interests into concrete projects, and managing ourselves and our projects so we can end up with digital artifacts that are functional, unique, and somewhat whimsical and magical:)
                </p>

        <div class="textbox">
            <h2>üí° Some of what we'll be doing/learning</h2>
            <p>This course will be centered around you using similar toolsets to do divergent projects that reflect your tastes and interests! Therefore, each of you will be learning and doing slightly different things! However, you'll all be developing certain skillsets related to creating original digital projects including but not limited to:</p>
            <h3>üóìÔ∏è Project Management Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Translating your interests into concrete project ideas</li> <br>
                <li>Specifying and designing a programming project</li> <br>
                <li>Breaking the project into different parts and planning when you'll finish each part </li> <br>
                <li>Breaking each part into even smaller programmable code-sketches</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>üíª Skills Related to Web Development & Programming</h3>
            <p>In the process of creating and formatting webpages that represent ideas you care about, you'll end up being able to do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create, format, and style elements on a webpage in a way that you find beautiful and that work on a computer (and a smartphone)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Debug a problem in your code by using your console, google, such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/guides/beginner/">css tricks</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">mdn</a>, etc., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q">pair programming</a>, and talking through problems with each other.</li> <br>
                    <li>Like in an art class, you'll all to your palette of computational tools and ideas to make resourcesall kinds of things! For example, your pallette might include using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G41G_PEWFjE">variables</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWQfa4CHbw">functions</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDi7xgIIW8E">if statements</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seBDTeZmb-k">arrays</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIlCLjjm8M0">for loops,</a> to make different representations and functionalities on a webpage! </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>üí≠Thinking about Thinking</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Seeing your own mental models</b>: When I write a program and the outcome is different from what I expect, it's often because I have a misconception. Somthing I love about coding is that, I can SEE my misconceptions.
                        <br><br>Similarly I love that there's no right answer. Instead, the difference between how you and someone else solve a problem reflects a beautiful diversity in thought which you can actually <i>see</i> in the code! <br><br> In this class, you'll learn to think and talk more explicitlly about your thinking!
                    </li>
                    <br><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Debugging</b>: In CS1, we'll often use our console and trial and error to debug problems, but we'll also discuss what we predict our code will do, what it actually does, and our assumptions about how we think things work. This will help us get better at thinking about our own thinking!
                    </li>

    <section id="expectations">

            <h1>Expectations</h1>
            <ol>
                <h3>
                    <li>Collaboration
                </h3> In this class, computation and computer programming is what we're <i>using</i> to create personally meaningful projects. You're not being assessed "about" computer programming. You'll be assessing your own success based on your individual development and your own projects.<br><br> Thus, there's really no competition in and no scarcity of good grades in this class. If you make a cool project, you'll have it on your personal website forever and I want each person to make things they care about! Thus, you are <i>expected</i> to help each other a lot! Don't think of collaborating as cheating. It's important that we support each other because we won't be able to get everything done without collaboration!</li><br><br>
                <h3>
                    <li>Humility
                </h3> Techy culture is infamous for mansplaining. Let's do something better! There is no single right answer in programming. In fact, usually there are tons of "right answers" as long as the code works! For that reason and because we want a vibrant, inclusive, supportive vibe, no matter how techy you may feel, in this class you're expected to be kind, helpful, and use your knowledge to help yourself and others. Here we're not into showing off just to look smart! Don't make anyone feel less technical than you and if you don't feel or identify as techical, don't worry about it! It really isn't relevant ‚Äî you can make great stuff in this class even if you've never used a computer before!</li>
                <h3>
                    <li>Weekly Journal (<a href="http://goerkederyk.weebly.com/creating-a-flying-machine.html">2</a> <a href="https://mojopi.github.io">examples</a> of a journal)
                </h3> On your personal websites each week, you'll each submit one code-sketch (often related to your personal project), an explanation of how it works, what you like/don't like about it, and a reflection about what you're learning. You can use photos of drawings or whatever else to make your thinking visible!</li>
                <br><br>
                <h3>
                    <li>
                        Working on your project at least 3-4 hrs/wk
                </h3> If you're not spending at least 3-4 hours per week programming or working on your project, then your project is probably not going to be as good as it can be!</li>
                <br><br>
                <h3>
                    <li>Weekly Labs
                </h3>Each of you should be having an individual or small group Lab every week and you must have a 1:1 Lab with me in the first two weeks of school!</li>
                <br><br>
                <h3>
                    <li>Ask for help!
                </h3>
                If you can't figure something out within 30 minutes, you are expected to post a question to our TKclass Slack chat, on TKthis form!</li>

You inpsire me. <br> <br> In these challenging, less structured times, I will continue to be here to support you in doing projects you really care about (<i>e.g.</i> making podcasts, presents for people you love, games for your friends, children's stories, etc). <br><br> Below are some starting points for projects, all of which I hope will be made publically available in our community. If you make great, <a href="https://abidsikder.com/portfolio/index.html">art</a>, or stories(<i>e.g.</i> <a href="https://c23kh4.github.io/Umbra.html">UMBRA</a> ‚Äî explanation <a href="https://c23kh4.github.io/umbraexp.html">here</a>, <a href="http://thisteenagelife.org/">podcasts</a>, <a href="https://mojopi.github.io/children-stories/">children's books</a>), I believe a lot of people will want to engage with them beacause they'll be looking for stuff to do. Actually <i>making</i> the work that inspires others to do their own creative projects, could be a really beautiful way to contribute during this time.

            <p>You know how I feel about thisüòä. It's <b>way</b> more fun than you'd expect! Here are some projects that are already happening. You can also, of course, make your own.</p>
            <p style="color:purple"><b>Stories from the Subway</b></p>
            There are two people in one of my classes already working on a podcast about stories from the subway. If you'd like to submit a story, make a subway codesketch or be interviewed via google meet, please message me on slack and I'll connect you with them.</p>

I'll be happy to guide you through how to make an episode.</p>
            <!-- <p>We record primarily in quicktime (on a computer) or voice memos (on a smartphone) in a quite place. We denoise the audio in a program called Audacity and actually edit in a program called Garage Band. If interested, slack me!</p> -->

            </li>
            <p>I'll be playing around with the javascript libraries (i.e. functions that other people made) called p5.js and snap.svg. I brought the pen plotter home so you can email me svg drawings you make with snap.svg and I can print them out!
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://p5js.org/">Here</a> is the p5.js website and <a href="https://share.getcloudapp.com/v1urjPrz">here</a>is an e-pub copy of the book The Nature of Code By Daniel Shiffman. I'm going to use this to make DIGITAL generative art.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://snapsvg.io/">Here</a> is Snap.svg, which I will use to make art which I will then PRINT OUT via the axidraw pen plotter I told you about:)</li>

                <p>I'm going to be running a website or an instagram page with stuff people photograph/draw. I'm particularly excited about what people could make with macro lenses, which I can order you on Amazon if you'd like to use them for a project. If so, message me on slack or email me. When I was bored one summer, I used a macro lens to take all of <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/4872845">these videos of snails. Let me know if you're interested!</a>.

                </center>
            </p>
            In terms of how to do these, here are some guidelines about process</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Coming up with an idea:</b> you have an authentic need (like a gift you want to give someone) OR you're inspired by something you see perhaps on the class website or on TKJennifer Dewalt's website.</li>
                <li>Planning: You make a quick blueprint or mock up of what you're going to make and how it's going to work (<a href="resources.html">here is my octopus arm code sketch and mock up.</a>)</li>
                <li>You program it: You use sublime text (or another text editor), and you have it open next to your Chrome browser window. Each time you make a change, you save and refresh your browser window. You use the console to debug. You google things when you don't have the words for them (e.g. how do I set the width for a div CSS) and look at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>. You refer to the <a href="resources.html">class resources page</a> for videos and cheat sheets. When you're stuck, you message the class slack channel and we'll help you!</li>

                            It's hard to really get a grasp of what it means for something to grow exponentially.
                            Listen to <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/dispatch-numbers">this episode</a> from Radiolab and then make your own representation of something growing exponentially. You can, for instance, make a javascript function that makes some sort of div and which, using a for loop and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/pow">Math.pow()</a> function to reproduce or grow exponentially. Or you can make something that shows to scale, what it really means for something to grow exponentially. For instance, one of the people on Radiolab talks about if his office grew exponentially, how long it would take for it to be the size of the world (not long ‚Äî ~12 days). He also talks about whether to take a 1 million dollar payment or someone who'd give him a penny but that payment grew exponentially. You can choose to represent either of these things or something entirely different but make a code sketch that really <i>shows</i> what it means for something to grow exponentially.

                        <td>A good code sketch will make you feel like "Oh wow! I cant believe how crazy it is that it grows that fast!" It'll make you really be able to <i>feel</i> and visualize what it means for something to at an exoponential rate. It'll have a clear title and description so that anyone who saw it new what it was a model of. In addition to making the codesketch, you have linked it to your website and written a post in your journal about your code, why you chose to make what you made, what exponential means to you now vs. before.</td>
