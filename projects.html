        <p>There are some things you have to do for this class (<i>e.g.</i> make a person card, personal website with a journal, write in your journal each week) but the rest is for you to decide. This year, there are several possible project options that I'm providing for inspiration. If you want to do a project outside of these options, just like with all projects, you'll describe and pitch it in a project proposal. Project options this year include but aren't limited to:</p>

           <b>Stories from the Subway</b></p>
            There are two people in one of my classes already working on a podcast about stories from the subway. If you'd like to submit a story, make a subway code sketch or be interviewed via google meet, please message me on slack and I'll connect you with them.

                <li>Make Generative Art!
            </h3>
            </li>
            <p>You can play around with  javascript libraries (i.e. functions that other people made) called D3, p5.js and snap.svg. I brought the pen plotter home so you can email me svg drawings you make with snap.svg and I can print them out!
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://p5js.org/">Here</a> is the p5.js website and <a href="https://share.getcloudapp.com/v1urjPrz">here</a>is an e-pub copy of the book The Nature of Code By Daniel Shiffman. I'm going to use this to make DIGITAL generative art.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://snapsvg.io/">Here</a> is Snap.svg, which I will use to make art which I will then PRINT OUT via the axidraw pen plotter I told you about:)</li>
                    <li>If you want to make amazing mathemtical/generative art on scratch, it's amazing. <a href="https://share.getcloudapp.com/P8uRZ9z5">Here's</a> a book you may find useful.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWkPOfnGsw">Here</a> is a youtube channel by the library's founder with great lessons about how to code with p5.js</li>

                <p>I'm going to be running a website or an instagram page with stuff people photograph/draw. I'm particularly excited about what people could make with macro lenses, which I can order you on Amazon if you'd like to use them for a project. If so, message me on slack or email me. When I was bored one summer, I used a macro lens to take all of <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/4872845">these videos of snails. Let me know if you're interested!</a>. -->

                        <li>Do Project Euler Problems!</li>
                    </h3>
                    <p><a href='https://projecteuler.net/archives'>These</a> are challenging, and very stimulating math problems that are too big to solve by hand. But you can solve them with code! I recommend first writing out your ideas on paper and writing your algorithms/functions in English first so even if the syntax of Javascript is getting in the way, you're able to show the ideas behind your code even if your code isn't where you want it to be.</p>

            </h3>
            <p style="color:magenta;">...Obviously they're not mutually exclusive..</p>
            <p>You can make a story for a student in First Program, for kids in other states/countries who are also out of school, for your friends, grandma, whomever! To get started, think of your favorite movies, children's books, YA stories, mystery books, etc. Think about what makes them good. Make an adaption or make your own story inspired by it!</p>

            <ul>
                <li>This is a digital picture book I made for a friend. We used to read books together and talk about a lot of ideas we cared about. It was a present. Through this project I learned HTML and CSS. I drew all of the drawings in it in a free app called <a href="https://paper.bywetransfer.com/">Paper</a> and To see the story, Click on "link" in the picture of the iphone, click on all of the gears. It'll bring you to a picture book which is inpsired by most of my favorite books. If you click on any picture, quotes from some of m</li>

            <p>Many of you have played with <a href="https://c23kh4.github.io/Umbra.html">UMBRA</a>. It's awesome. To make your own interactive story:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Make a blueprint:</b> Make a "mock up" that lays out the idea of your story. Below is an example of a mock up for an interactive children's book that someone is making for little kids they volunteer with.</li><br>

                    <li><b>Download Twine</b> (the tool we've been using to make interactive stories) from the software center on your computer. You can also download it from <a href="https://twinery.org/2/#!/welcome">Twine's website.</a></p>
            <li> <b> Layout your story in Twine:</b> Watch<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKFZhIHD7Xk"> this tutorial.</a>.</li><br>
            <li>Put together the pages/blocks of your story and conect them via [[links]]. Here's what it will look like:</li><br><br>

            <li><b>Style your story:</b>Using the stylesheet in Twine you can change the font color, family, background images, etc. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=twine+tutorial+stylesheet&oq=twine+tutorial+stylesheet&aqs=chrome..69i57j0.6109j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#kpvalbx=_aQxpXprLDfyoytMPtdiZEA32">Here's a tutorial</a> on how to change the styling (CSS) of your story and here's an amazing resource <a href="https://twinery.org/cookbook/?q=">The Twine Cookbook</a> that tells how to customize everything</li> <br><br>
            <li>To add mazes, passwords, puzzles, and interactivity to your story, read the <a href="https://twine2.neocities.org/#markup_link">manual for Harlowe 3.1</a>, which describes all these cool functions you can embed in your text in twine.</li>

                <li><b>Add and style your text:</b> each [section][/section] tag (haha, I can't type the "<'s" because this website is made of code) is one slide. To add text, I'd add [p class="fragment" ][/p] (paragraph tags with the class of fragment, around your text, within each section. I'd also add a google font that you like by adding the font link to the top of your HTML page in the "head" section and by creating a "style" section in the head and setting .fragment{ font-family:____" } </li> <br><br>
                <li><b>Make your images:</b> in paper! or something else you like! Use photography from your phone — macrophotography looks especially good!</li><br><br>
